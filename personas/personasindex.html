                <h1> Personas and Storyboarding: The SciLi Vending Machine</h1>
                <p> Have you ever tried to put yourself in the shoes of another person? Envisioned what it was like to be a different user? In this webpage, we explore 
                    how different users may interact with different interfaces. Through surveying users, observing their interactions with an interface, and synthesizing these
                    insights, we have constructed different personas and a storyboard for a vending machine.

                <h2 class = "heading">Interface Overview</h2>
                <p>Ever felt so hungry, yet in a rush for time? Want to get rid of loose change in exchange for a snack? A vending machine might
                    be your answer! A vending machine providers users the option of buying a small snack (chips, candy, gym, etc.) for a couple of dollars. 
                    There are 2 main components to a vending machine: (1) the "screen" that displays the variety of snacks and (2) the payment portion where users 
                    can swipe their credit card or insert cash and make a selection of which snack they want. A more detailed diagram of this is shown below:

                <h2 class = "heading">Questions and Observations</h2>
                <p> <b> Observations: </b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b> Payment: </b> All users used a credit card as their payment method. A majority of users (2/3) had to swipe/tap their credit card more than once. </li>
                    <li> <b> Snack Selection: </b> All users used the keypad at least twice in their interaction with this interface. Reasons for doing so include checking the price
                        of different items and having the machine time out and then having to re-enter their item selection.</li>
                    <li> <b> Types of Users: </b> Users who were carrying their books, backpack, and/or other items took less time to grab their item from the vending machine and
                        exit the Science Library. </li>
                </ul>
                <p> <b>Questions: </b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li> <i>Did you encounter any difficulty in using this vending machine?</i> </li>
                    <ul> <li> Most users faced some minor obstacles, including having to swipe their credit card twice, having to indicate their snack selection twice, or
                        a lag time between when they selected their snack and when it got dispensed. However none of these obstacles would discourage them from using the machine again. </li></ul>
                        <br>
                    <li> <i>What was your goal in using this vending machine, and were you able to accomplish it? </i></li>
                    <ul><li> Everyone's goal was to purchase a quick snack, and everybody was able to accomplish their goal. </li></ul>
                    <br>
                    <li> <i>How long were you expecting this encounter to take? Were your expectations met; why or why not? </i></li>
                    <ul><li> Everyone expected their encounter to take 1-2 minutes, and a majority of the time, this expectation was met. However one user had trouble with their
                        credit card that they do not attribute to the interface of the vending machine, thus, the interaction took longer than expected. </li></ul>
                        <br>
                    <li> <i>What, if anything, couple be improved about your experience using this vending machine (excluding the selection of items inside)? </i></li>
                    <ul><li> Despite everyone's relative satisfaction with the machine (as everyone indicated they would use it again), users had several potential improvements: </li>
                    <ul><li> Using FlexPoints is a hassle; despite the machine stating that it accepts them, it didn't work for one user in the past</li>
                        <li> Users did not like that they had to bend down to pick up their snack and would rather it be dispensed in a different way (similar to drink machines)</li>
                        <li> If users want to purchase multiple snacks, they shouldn't have to swipe their card multiple times</li>
                        <li> It can be unclear if a label correponds to the snack above or below that label</li>
                    </ul>
                    </ul>
