        <div> <h1> From Manufacturer to Patient: Why is the Cost of Prescription Drugs So Darn High? An analysis of the FDA drug approval process and strategies that contribute to the high cost of drugs</h1></div>
        <div> <p>This is a final research paper written for my public health capstone on the topic of evergreening in the pharmaceutical industry. While writing this paper,
            I learned several important skills such as how to conduct a literary search, write a review, and conduct an evidence synthesis. 
        </p></div>

        <div> <h2>Introduction</h2></div>
        <div> <p> 
            The US healthcare system is plagued by its high cost low value economic structure. Skyrocketing pharmaceutical prices and a lack of adequate insurance coverage has left many Americans unable to afford to be healthy. Nearly 80% of Americans believe that the price of prescription drugs are unreasonable (Lopes et al., 2019). In a country where over 60% of the population takes at least 1 prescription drug and 89% of adults 65 and older take at least 1 prescription drug, (Lopes et al., 2019), the deathly effects of unaffordable drugs is a widespread issue. Projections for 2030 indicate that 112,000 seniors could die prematurely because of how unaffordable prescription drugs are (Dickson, 2020). <br> <br> 

        The increase in drug prices has been a historical trend. From 2008 to 2015, the price for the most common brand name drugs increased 164% (Kesselheim et al., 2016). This is 13x the consumer price index (12%), or the average increase of the price of consumer goods. Moreover, the average price of specialty drugs in 2016 was $250,00 (Kesselheim et al., 2016). These price tags grow exponentially as the prevalence of disease decreases; orphan drugs (drugs used to treat diseases that affect less than 200,000 people) are some of the most expensive drugs (Kesselheim et al., 2016). Skysona, a recently approved gene therapy for cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, a rare neurological disease, has a $3M list price (the price listed by a manufacturer before any discounts or insurance payments) (Liu, Angus, 2022). These high prices have put a strain on Americans; in 2016, 33% of uninsured Americans and 14% of insured Americans cited cost as a reason for not taking their prescribed drugs, compared to less than 10% of residents of Switzerland, Australia, France, UK, and other European countries (Bishop, 2017). <br> <br> 
        There are many reasons for the high cost of drugs, from the extensive supply chain to high research and development (R&D) costs. On the high end, one study cited the R&D costs of drugs to be nearly $2.8B per drug (DiMasi et al., 2016) (although this study was controversial due to its methodology; researchers included the opportunity cost of not investing money spent on R&D in other ventures) whereas on the lower end one study cited R&D costs to amount to $985.3M (Wouters et al., 2020). Several pharmaceutical companies defend their high price tag with their high investment costs, especially given the overall low success rates of gaining FDA approval. In addition to R&D cost, there is an extensive supply chain for pharmaceuticals: from manufacturers to wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies, pharmacy benefit managers and more. <br> <br> 
        However, one indisputable cause for the high price tag of prescription drugs is evergreening, or the practice of pharmaceutical companies to extend their patent exclusivity to maximize profits. To encourage the R&D of novel therapies, the FDA grants exclusivity to pharmaceutical companies for a certain time period (depending on drug type) prohibiting competitors or generics to enter the market. Delaying generics and competitors from entering the market enables companies to sell their drugs with high list prices. One study showed that after generics entered the market, prices for oral medications decreased 90% after 30 months (Dickson, 2020), slashing profits for pharmaceutical companies. However, the FDA provides companies exclusivity provisions for companies to extend their exclusivity with novel research. In the act of evergreening, pharmaceutical companies will oftentimes file for exclusivity extensions for making non consequential changes to their drugs. <br> <br> 
        Evergreening strategies oftentimes do not entail significantly improving the efficacy of drugs, rather, entail making miniscule changes to drugs. Consequently, some argue that evergreening provisions thwart innovation and promote a culture of cheap profits. One study found that 78% of new patents filed from 2005-2015 were for existing compounds. Moreover, of the 100 best selling drugs, 70% received extended exclusivity once and nearly half of them received extended exclusivity multiple times (Feldman, 2018). The prevalence of evergreening is on an upward trend (Feldman, 2018), contributing to the skyrocketing cost of pharmaceuticals. This in turn increases profits for pharmaceutical companies whilst leaving care and treatment unaffordable for Americans. <br> <br>  
        This study analyzes various types of evergreening strategies pharmaceutical companies use and abuse through an analysis of several case studies. <br> <br> 

        </p></div>

        <div> <h2>Methods</h2></div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Studies published on PubMed and ScienceDirect were analyzed. The search terms "evergreening" and "fda" and "patent" were used to find papers on the topic of evergreening in the US. These results were further filtered down to only reviews and journal articles published in the last 10 years. The titles of the articles were first assessed to ensure that they were relevant to the purpose of this study. Then, the abstract, introduction, and methods were read to ensure that the data was focused on various evergreening strategies in the US. Articles that mentioned several countries (including the US) were also included, although this analysis focuses on the US and data about other countries was omitted from this study. Because many of the articles discussed evergreening in different countries, geographical relevance was qualitatively assessed while reading each article (as opposed to filtered out from the beginning). Moreover, each article was qualitatively assessed to ensure that they discussed evergreening in the context of prescription drugs; papers on medical devices or digital therapeutics were excluded.
                <br><br>
                From each paper, information regarding evergreening strategies were collected and synthesized. Data from the papers were reviews from other primary studies that collected data from the FDA Orange Book or case studies. Articles were assessed in 3 domains: methodology of data collection and quality and quantity of examples. Although articles were not formally scored, all articles included a robust methodology and satisfactory quality and quantity of examples included. For example, papers that vaguely discussed the impacts of evergreening as a whole but did not mention a specific strategy or example of a company that employed evergreening strategies were not included. Evergreening strategies were then consolidated into the following categories: chemical changes, dose change, administration change, new conditions, reformulation, and others (pediatric indication, generic entry, pay for delay). Examples of pharmaceutical companies practicing these evergreening strategies were recorded, as well as an estimated magnitude of the effect of evergreening (in terms of cost). <br><br>
                All articles were organized by the citation manager Zotero.

        <div>
            <h2>Results</h2></div>
            <p> 7 papers on evergreening strategies were analyzed to synthesize various evergreening strategies and measure the added cost burden on the healthcare system because of evergreening. These 7 papers were narrowed down from an initial amount of 78 using the evaluation criteria described in the methods sections. Studies relating to the US that cited case studies were included in this analysis. The evergreening strategies researched include:
            </p>
            <h4> Chemical Changes</h4>
            <p>There are 2 primary methods of chemical changes pharmaceutical companies pursue: chiral switching (when a mixture of enantiomers is consolidated into a single, pure enantiomer) and molecular changes (isolating active ingredients) (Andrade et al., 2022). Oftentimes, there is a lack of sufficient evidence to prove a chemical change yields increased efficacy. One example of a chiral change is with escitalopram and citalopram. Celexa R © (R/S-citalopram), an SSRI manufactured by Forest Laboratories, was approved in 1998 with exclusivity till 2004. In 2002, Forest Laboratories released Lexapro R © (escitalopram) in anticipation of their expiring exclusivity on Celexa. However, head-to-head studies between escitalopram and citalopram show no clinical benefit of the former, despite its increased cost (Lehmann & Wojnowicz, 2016). </p>
            <h4>Combination</h4>
            <p>Pharmaceutical companies may combine their drug treatment with another compound (another prescription drug, vitamin, etc.) to extend their exclusivity with the hope that this will make treatments more effective (Siddalingaiah & Fugh-Berman, 2022). An example of this is Fosamax plus D, an osteoporosis drug mixed with vitamin D (Siddalingaiah & Fugh-Berman, 2022). Given the current treatment landscape, combination therapies are an emerging evergreening strategy in oncology. More specifically, combining vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors with immunotherapies are a popular research focus (Strohbehn et al., 2021). However, a majority of clinical trials are designed to seek FDA approval, as opposed to investigate the efficacy changes and adverse effects of a combination therapy. An analysis of 24 clinical trials found that none of them were designed to identify unexpected results of the combination therapy (Strohbehn et al., 2021). 
            </p>
            <h4>Dose Change</h4>
            <p>
                Pharmaceutical companies may create a new dosage of the same drug to prevent a generic entry through extended exclusivity.  One example of this is Doxepin to Silenor (Andrade et al., 2022). Doxepin is a tricyclic antidepressant used to treat anxiety or depression. Silenor is branded doxepin but at a lower 3mg or 6mg dose, used to treat insomnia (Patel & Goldman-Levine, n.d.). However, the monthly cost of Silenor at CVS (30 tablets, 3mg) is $118.72 compared to $9.63 for the monthly cost of generic Doxepin (30 tablets, 10mg) (Goodrx). Differences in dosages exist so that physicians can individualize patient treatment, however, it also provides pharmaceutical companies the option to extend their exclusivity through inconsequential drug changes (Siddalingaiah & Fugh-Berman, 2022). For example, Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals changed the ethinyl estradiol dosage of their oral contraceptive Yasmin from .02mg to 0.03mg although there were no proven benefits of doing so (Siddalingaiah & Fugh-Berman, 2022). Moreover, Aricept (donepezil), a dementia drug was first produced in 10mg doses, however, 23 mg doses were later released despite no significant evidence of added efficacy. The 23 mg doses had three times the number of adverse side effects, however, and was 10 times more expensive than the original (Siddalingaiah & Fugh-Berman, 2022). 
            </p>
            <h4>New Indications</h4>
            <p>Pharmaceutical companies can seek approval for a new indication with the same drug to extend their exclusivity (Andrade et al., 2022). An example of this includes when the manufacturer of Prozac (fluoxetine), an antidepressant, extended its exclusivity through rebranding the same exact drug and dose as Sarafem, used to treat Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (Andrade et al., 2022). Other examples include Lumigen (a glaucoma drug) being rebranded as Latisse (an eyelash extender), Viagra (used to treat erectile dysfunction) being rebranded as Revatio (for primary pulmonary hypertension), and Wellbutrin (antidepressant) being rebranded as Zyban (a smoking cessation drug) (Andrade et al., 2022). Seeking approval for new indications benefits companies by allowing them to extend their exclusivity on the original drug whilst also allowing them to enter a new market. 
            </p>
            <h4>Reformulation</h4>
            <p>Reformulation of a drug involves changing how the drug is delivered or absorbed in the human body (Andrade et al., 2022). One example of this is with omeprazole, a drug used to treat several conditions such as heartburn, stomach ulcers, and acid reflux. Omeprazole, owned by AstraZeneca, is branded under several names, such as Losec®, Antra®, Gastroloc®, Mopral®, Omepral® and Prilosec® (Lloyd, 2013). Given how profitable Omreprazole is, AstraZeneca filed several secondary patents on this drug, one of which claimed that a new coating on the drug slowed the absorption of it (Lloyd, 2013), extending its exclusivity. Overall, drug companies tend to release drugs in 4 different stages (in terms of how the drug is released): first as an immediate release, then controlled release, extended release, and lastly as a long acting formulation (Siddalingaiah & Fugh-Berman, 2022). One example of this is with Glucophage, a commonly prescribed drug for type 2 diabetes. It was originally released as Glucophage, but 5 years later, it was released as Glucophage XR. Both have the same effectiveness, although the latter is a one pill dose whereas the former is a 3 pill dose (Siddalingaiah & Fugh-Berman, 2022). Other examples of reformulation include Adderall and Adderall XR (Siddalingaiah & Fugh-Berman, 2022), Bupropion HLC to Bupropion XL, Valproic Acid to Depakote ER®, Lithium to Lithium ER, oral disintegrating forms of olanzapine and risperidone (Andrade et al., 2022), and a controlled release version of the ​​antidepressant Paxil® (Sanzenbacher & Wettstein, 2020). </p>
            <p>
                There are several limitations to this analysis. This is not a mutually exclusive nor completely exhaustive list of evergreening strategies, as companies will combine various evergreening strategies to maximize their exclusivity and do not use them independently. Moreover, this is a purely qualitative study and does not report on the overall cost burden of evergreening strategies but rather cites anecdotal evidence of increased cost.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Pharmaceutical companies can employ a variety of evergreening strategies to maximize their profits through extending their exclusivity. Despite the wide variety of strategies analyzed within the above 7 papers, the overwhelming key message is that evergreening dually harms patients by causing increased drug prices and limiting true innovation. Evergreened drugs are more expensive than their generic counterparts, making them unaffordable for many Americans. Moreover, evergreening promotes a culture of investing in research for miniscule, oftentimes inconsequential changes to a drug in order to extend exclusivity. 
                <br><br>
                There are several limitations to this study. Namely, this was a qualitative study that provided anecdotal evidence of evergreening strategies with select examples within the industry and select examples of the cost burden of evergreening. Not only that, but only 2 databases were used in this study so it is not exhaustive and does not summarize all of the evergreening strategies. Future iterations of this research can include more data on the cost burden of these evergreening strategies by including a more robust comparison of generic versus brand name prices, evaluating how long a company received extended exclusivity, and the prevalence of disease that a certain drug treats. Moreover, more research can be done on the positive effects of mitigating evergreening strategies; for example, research can be conducted on how many more Americans will be able to afford prescription drugs with lowered costs. Research can also be done to see which policies and types of policies have been most effective at curbing evergreening or making drugs more affordable. With the recent approval of Medicare Part D being able to negotiate drug prices, research into policy effectiveness is especially salient. 
                <br><br>
                Moving forward, there are several potential solutions to evergreening. Several evergreening strategies promote innovation in theory (such as chemical changes or reformulation), however, as described in this paper, are abused in practice. Thus, while idealistic, the FDA can impose stricter guidelines and stipulations on what evidence grants extended exclusivity. Moreover, there are other evergreening strategies such as pay for delay (where brand name companies will pay generic companies to delay their sale of generic drugs) that are blatantly unethical and unbeneficial to patients that should be abolished due to their monopolistic nature. However, it is understandable that it may be hard to motion for such large policy changes. 
                <br><br>
                There are also several strategies that consumers and providers can take. First is to be informed on the price discrepancies between brand name and generic drugs. Physicians can make it common practice to prescribe the generic version of the drug as opposed to the brand name, especially for patients who cannot afford brand name drugs. Consumers can also use websites such as Goodrx to see which pharmacist will provide their prescription at the cheapest cost, and ask their providers to send their prescriptions there. However, given how complex and confusing the healthcare system is, this knowledge may not be accessible in a digestible manner and thus educational campaigns are necessary to ensure patients are well informed. 
                <br><br>
                Overall, there are several evergreening strategies that pharmaceutical companies can maliciously use to prolong their profits. This makes prescriptions drugs unaffordable to many Americans, and more research into better policies to incentive innovation should be conducted.
